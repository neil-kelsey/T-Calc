# T-Calc
T-Calc is a terminal calculator project to help me learn C#

Welcome to take this and do with it as you please but this is my first C# project so it likely isn't perfect - any advice welcome!

Default Visual Studio project with two main two files;

/lesson_10/Program.cs

/lesson_10/Calc/Calculator.cs

This was created following the tutorial from Dani Krossings 'C# for beginners' playlist -
